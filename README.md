# C Programming: The Ultimate Guide

Welcome to the ultimate guide for learning C programming with real-life cases! Whether you're a beginner looking to dive into the world of programming or an experienced developer seeking to enhance your skills, this guide is designed to provide you with comprehensive knowledge and practical examples to master the C programming language.

## Table of Contents

1. [Operators and Expressions](#operators-and-expressions)
2. [Control Statements](#control-statements)

## Operators and Expressions

Operators in C are symbols that represent computations or operations on data. They can be used to manipulate variables and produce results.
Expressions in C are combinations of operators and operands that produce a result. They can be simple or complex, and they evaluate to a value.

- [Arithmetic Operators](https://github.com/Kushalshakya/C-Programming/blob/main/OperatorsAndExpressions/ArthimeticOperator.c)
- [Bitwise Operators](https://github.com/Kushalshakya/C-Programming/blob/main/OperatorsAndExpressions/BitwiseOperator.c)
- [Increment And Decrement Operators](https://github.com/Kushalshakya/C-Programming/blob/main/OperatorsAndExpressions/IncrementDecrementOperator.c)
- [Logical Operators](https://github.com/Kushalshakya/C-Programming/blob/main/OperatorsAndExpressions/LogicalOperator.c)
- [Relational Operators](https://github.com/Kushalshakya/C-Programming/blob/main/OperatorsAndExpressions/RelationalOperator.c)
- [Ternary Operators](https://github.com/Kushalshakya/C-Programming/blob/main/OperatorsAndExpressions/TernaryOperator.c)
- [Unary Operators](https://github.com/Kushalshakya/C-Programming/blob/main/OperatorsAndExpressions/UnaryOperator.c)

## Control Statements
Understand control statements such as if-else statements and different types of loops (for, while, do-while) to make decisions and control the flow of execution in your programs. We'll cover conditional statements, nested loops, and practical examples.
