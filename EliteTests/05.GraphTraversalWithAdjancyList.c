/* Graph Traversal Using Adjacency List
Implement a C program that:
    Uses an adjacency list to represent a graph.
    Allows the user to enter N vertices and E edges.
    Implements Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the graph.

Enter number of vertices: 4
Enter number of edges: 3
Enter edges (u v):
1 2
1 3
3 4

DFS Traversal: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4
