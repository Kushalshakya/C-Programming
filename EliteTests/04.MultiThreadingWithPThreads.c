/* Multi-threading with Pthreads
Write a multi-threaded C program using POSIX threads (pthread).

The program should:
    Create N threads where each thread calculates the factorial of its thread index.
    Use pthread_create to spawn threads and pthread_join to ensure proper execution.
    Print the result for each thread.

Output:
    Thread 1: 1
    Thread 2: 2
    Thread 3: 6
    Thread 4: 24
    Thread 5: 120
    Note: Handle thread synchronization properly.
