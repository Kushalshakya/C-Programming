/* Pointer Arithmetic and Memory Management
Write a C program that dynamically allocates memory for an integer array of n elements using malloc. Then, fill the array with the first n prime numbers, display them, and finally, free the allocated memory.

Constraints:
    1. Do not use global variables.
    2. Use pointer arithmetic instead of array indexing.
    3. Implement a separate function to check if a number is prime.
